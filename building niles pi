The best way to implement an Alexa controller for a Niles GXR-2 is to use an Amazon 
skill to communicate with a raspberry pi via an MQTT broker.  A lambda function 
that is triggered by the skill publishes update messages to a topic on the broker 
and the raspberry pi subscribes to the topic and acts on the update messages.
Traffic would be one way and could be QoS 0 (up to one message) because message
loss would be immediately recognized by the user as a command failure.  The 
result would be that the user would merely repeat the command.

The build process would be as follows:

Create an Alexa skill
Create a new lambda function that publishes to the AWS MQTT broker (this would be done on the 
AWS console, not the skills console)
Paste the skill ID into the configuration for the lambda function
Alter the endpoint on the Alexa skill to point to the new lambda function
Create a skill trigger in the lambda function  
Alter the lambda profile to allow MQTT traffic 
Test your code with the AWS IoT test console on the IoT server
Write code for the raspberry pi that subscribes to the AWS MQTT broker
Use the alexa app or web site to install your skill
Test the skill with voice commands to Alexa 

Let's look at each step in detail:

1. Create an Alexa skill

There are several sub-steps to this step, and you need several things to make this work:

An amazon.com account
At least one echo device, or a cell phone with the amazon alexa app installed.
Internet access
A device that is powerfull enough to interact with amazon consoles (Raspberry pi with raspian would work.)

a.  Log into the Alexa Skills Kit Developers Console (https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask).  You will be presented 
with the skills menu page.
b.  Click on the "Create Skill".  The "Create New Skill" page will display.
c.  Enter a name for your skill and verify that "Custom Model" is selected as the model to add to your skill.  Click 
on the "Create Skill" button.  Alexa will create your skill.
d.  Navigate to the JSON editor under Interaction Model in the left menu pane of the console.  Delete the default JSON code
in the editor.  
e.  Open the gxr2.json file in this repository.  Copy the contents of the file and paste it into the JSON editor.
f.  Press on the Save button to save the code.  
g.  Go back to the skills menu page.  Your skill should be listed,
h.  Click on the "Copy Skill ID" link under your skill name in the list.  Your Skill ID will be copied to the clipboard.


2.  Create a new lambda function that publishes to the AWS MQTT broker

Successful completion of Step 1 is necessary to complete this step.  Also, you will need to create a separate account
on an Alexa Web Services server.  This is a separate service from the Alexa Skills Kit, and it is a good idea
to bookmark or save the URLs for both consoles, as they are difficult to locate if you don't know where to look. The URL
for the AWS console is dependent on the region that you are in.  For example, if you are on the West Coast, your
region would be "us-west-2" and the URL for your console would be 
"https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-west-2"

You can start by going to https://console.aws.amazon.com/ to get the URL for your region.

You are going to require a separate account on this server, and your log in includes a Captcha dialog with letters and numbers that 
are sometimes difficult to interpret.  This server also has a nasty habit of logging you out, even when you leave the Web page 
for only a few minutes.  If you are logged out, you'll want to close your browser, then reopen it before logging in. 

The following are the steps to create the lambda function:

a.  Log into the Amazon Web Services console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/)
b.  Type "lambda" in the search text box and press Enter.  Select lamda from the list of services that display.
    The lambda function page will display.
c.  Click on the "New Function" button. The create function page will display.
d.  Enter a name for the function and click on the "create function" button.  The function will be created.
e.  Download the contents of this repository to your local computer and extract the files.
f.  Locate the index.js and al

3. Paste the skill ID into the configuration for the lambda function

The skill ID was copied in step 1e.  To complete this step you need to paste it into the skill ID text box using these procedures:

a.  From the functions page of the AWS lambda control panel, click on the function that you created.  The page for the function 
    will display.
b.  Click on the "add trigger" button.  The "Add Trigger" page will display.
c.  Click on the down arrow to the right of the "Select a Trigger" text box.  A list of triggers will display.
d.  Click on the "Alexa Skills Kit" trigger to select it. The "Trigger configuration" page will display.
e.  Paste the "Skill ID" copied in Step 1 to the "Skill ID" text box and then click on Add.  The "Function overview" page displays 
    and a confirmation message will display,
